    Converts a tree structure to a DataFrame representation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    tree : dict
        A dictionary representing the tree structure.
    root_coords : numpy.ndarray
        The coordinates of the root node.
    start_coords : numpy.ndarray
        The coordinates of the start node.

    Returns
    -------
    nodes_df : pd.dataframe
        The DataFrame representation of the tree nodes.
    end_nodes : list
        A list of end node IDs.
    branching_nodes : list
        A list of branching node IDs.

    Notes
    -----
    This function converts a tree structure, specified as a dictionary,
    to a DataFrame representation. The tree structure should have node
    coordinates as keys and lists of child coordinates as values.

    The function performs a depth-first search (DFS) traversal of the tree,
    starting from the root coordinates. It keeps track of visited nodes to
    avoid revisiting them. The resulting DataFrame contains columns for node
    ID, x, y, z coordinates, parent ID, and node tags. The parent ID is set
    to -1 for the start coordinates. The function also identifies end nodes
    and branching nodes, storing their IDs in separate lists.

    Constructs a pandas DataFrame representing branches of a given tree structure. 
    
    The function builds a primary branch starting from p_end_node and iteratively

    tertiary branches are added. A branch degree is then defined for each branch. 
    The function finally measures branch lengths and discards branches that don't

    characteristics of the branches such as the number of nodes and the distance of 
    branching points along parent branches.
    
    Parameters
    ----------

    p_start_node : int

    end_nodes : List[int]
        List of node ids that represent the endpoints of all branches.
        
    branchthreshold : float

    nodethreshold : int

    Returns
    -------

        start and end nodes, branch length, and more.

    the construction of the tree structure (e.g., each node has a parent except for the root).
